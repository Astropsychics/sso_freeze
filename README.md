# SSO_Freeze Utility

This is a python script designed to transform .fits images from Chandra/XMM into solar-system object coordinates. Additionally, a region file with the sso coordinates and approximate size are generated. Type './sso_freeze.py -h' to access the help page, which includes input format and options.  

Note: this script only requires the .fits file; no secondary data products are required. In addition, astroquery 0.3.9 or higher is required.
