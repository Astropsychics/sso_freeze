# SSO_Freeze Utility

This is a python script designed to transform .fits images from Chandra/XMM into solar-system object coordinates. Additionally, a region file with the sso coordinates and approximate size are generated. Input parameters are stored in the inputs.par files, and some examples are provided. 

Note: this script only requires the .fits; no secondary data products are required. In addition, astroquery 0.3.9 or higher is required.
